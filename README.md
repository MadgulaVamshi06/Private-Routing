Development of PrivateRoute Component: The creation of the `PrivateRoute` component enabled the application to control access to specific pages based on authentication status. 
This ensured that only authenticated users could access certain routes, enhancing security measures.

Update of Route Configuration: Updating the route configuration to integrate the `PrivateRoute` component streamlined the process of securing routes requiring authentication.
This cohesive approach ensured consistent handling of access control across the application.

Creation of Page Components: Developing separate components for each page, including Home, About, Contact, Products, and Login, facilitated clarity 
and organization within the project structure. Each component served a distinct purpose, contributing to the overall functionality of the application
.
Handling Authentication with Reqres API: The integration of the reqres API for user authentication simplified the management of user login sessions. 
Upon successful authentication, the API provided a token that was stored and utilized for implementing private routes, ensuring secure access to protected pages.

Integration of Data with FakeStore API: Leveraging the FakeStore API to fetch product data for the Products page enriched the application with dynamic content. This integration allowed for the display of real-time product information, enhancing the overall user experience.
